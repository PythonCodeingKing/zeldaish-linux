This is a zelda type game. This took me a little more than two months. 
To run it, run main.py. The controls are:
SPACE: ATTACK
ARROW KEYS: MOVE
P: PAUSE
B: BOMB
S: TOGGLE SWIMMING(SNORKEL)
C: SHOW EXIT (Not suggested)
C AGAIN: TURN SHOW EXIT OFF (Same as above)

!BETA TESTING VERSION!
*Use git to revert to stable*
